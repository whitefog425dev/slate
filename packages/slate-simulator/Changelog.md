### `0.3.0` — October 27, 2017

###### DEPRECATED

- **The `props.state` prop has been renamed to `props.value`.** This is to stay in line with `slate-react@0.9.0` where the same change was made to the `<Editor>`.

- **The `simulator.state` property is now `simulator.value`** This is to stay in line with `slate@0.29.0` where the same change as made to the `Change` objects.

### `0.2.0` — October 25, 2017

###### BREAKING
