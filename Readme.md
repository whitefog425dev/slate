Slate is a completely customizable framework for building rich text editors in the browser. You can think of it like a pluggable implementation of `contenteditable`, built with React and Immutable. Slate was inspired by [Draft.js](https://facebook.github.io/draft-js/) and [Prosemirror](http://prosemirror.net/).

_Slate is currently in **beta**, while work is being done on: cross-browser support, atomic node support, and collaboration support. It's completely useable, but you might need to pull request one or two fixes for your use case._

## Principles

- Built with React and Immutable for performant stateless re-rendering and developing ease.
- Based on a nested, recursive tree model just like the DOM, so that complex components are possible.
- Made with plugins as a first-class consideration, so that almost all the logic is customizable.
- Doesn't bake any opinions about the schema being edited into the core library.
- Designed to allow for collaborative editing to be layered on top.
