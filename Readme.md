# Slate

Slate is a completely customizable framework for building rich text editors in the browser. You can think of it like a pluggable implementation of `contenteditable`, built with React and Immutable.

_Slate was inspired by [Draft.js](https://facebook.github.io/draft-js/) and [Prosemirror](http://prosemirror.net/)._

## Principles

- Build around a nested, recursive tree model just like the DOM, so that complex schemas are possible.
- Make plugins a first-class consideration, so that almost all the logic is customizable.
- Don't bake any opinions about data types and schema into the core library.

## Examples

To get a sense for how Slate works, check out a few of the examples:

- Rich Text
- Plain Text
- Auto-markdown
- Links
- Tables
