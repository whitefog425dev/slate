# Introduction

[Slate](http://slatejs.org) is a _completely_ customizable framework for building rich text editors. [GitHub ⬈](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate)

Slate lets you build rich, intuitive editors like those in [Medium](https://medium.com/), [Dropbox Paper](https://www.dropbox.com/paper) or [Canvas](https://usecanvas.com/)—which are becoming table stakes for applications on the web—without your codebase getting mired in complexity.

It can do this because all of its logic is implemented with a series of plugins, so you aren't ever constrained by what _is_ or _isn't_ in "core". You can think of it like a pluggable implementation of `contenteditable` built on top of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Immutable](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/). It was inspired by libraries like [Draft.js](https://facebook.github.io/draft-js/), [Prosemirror](http://prosemirror.net/) and [Quill](http://quilljs.com/).

_**Slate is currently in beta**. It's useable now, but you might need to pull request a fix or two for advanced use cases._

### Why?

Why create Slate? Well... _(Beware: this section has a few of [my](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor) opinions!)_

Before creating Slate, I tried a lot of the other rich text libraries out there. What I found was that while getting simple examples to work might be possible, once you start trying to build something like [Medium](https://medium.com/), [Dropbox Paper](https://www.dropbox.com/paper) or [Canvas](https://usecanvas.com/), you have to resort to very hacky things to get the user experience you want. And some experiences are just impossible. On the way, your codebase becomes harder and harder to maintain.

Of course those are my own opinions, and if those libraries solve your needs, use them! But if you've tried using any of those libraries you might have run into similar problems. If so, you might like Slate. Which brings me to how Slate solves all of that...


<br/>

### Principles

Slate tries to solve the question of "[Why?](#why)" with a few principles:

1. **First-class plugins.** The most important part of Slate is that plugins are first-class entities—the core editor logic is even implemented as its own plugin. That means you can _completely_ customize the editing experience, to build complex editors like Medium's or Canvas's without having to fight against the library's assumptions.

2. **Schema-less core.** Slate's core logic doesn't assume anything about the schema of the data you'll be editing, which means that there are no assumptions baked into the library that'll trip you up when you need to go beyond basic usage.

3. **Nested document model.** The document model used for Slate is a nested, recursive tree, just like the DOM itself. This means that creating complex components like tables or nested block quotes are possible for advanced use cases. But it's also easy to keep it simple by only using a single level of hierarchy.

4. **Stateless and immutable data.** By using React and Immutable.js, the Slate editor is built in a stateless fashion using immutable data structures, which leads to much easier to reason about code, and a much easier time writing plugins.

5. **Intuitive changes.** Slate's content is edited using "changes", that are designed to be high level and extremely intuitive to use, so that writing plugins and custom functionality is as simple as possible.

6. **Collaboration-ready data model.** The data model Slate uses—specifically how changes are applied to the document—has been designed to allow for collaborative editing to be layered on top, so you won't need to rethink everything if you decide to make your editor collaborative. (More work is required on this!)

7. **Clear "core" boundaries.** With a plugin-first architecture, and a schema-less core, it becomes a lot clearer where the boundary is between "core" and "custom", which means that the core experience doesn't get bogged down in edge cases.

### Examples

To get a sense for how you might use Slate, check out a few of the examples:

- [**Plain text**](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/tree/master/examples/plain-text) — showing the most basic case: a glorified `<textarea>`.
- [**Rich text**](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/tree/master/examples/rich-text) — showing the features you'd expect from a basic editor.
- [**Auto-markdown**](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/tree/master/examples/markdown-preview) — showing how to add key handlers for Markdown-like shortcuts.
- [**Links**](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/tree/master/examples/links) — showing how wrap text in inline nodes with associated data.
- [**Images**](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/tree/master/examples/images) — showing how to use void (text-less) nodes to add images.
- [**Hovering menu**](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/tree/master/examples/hovering-menu) — showing how a contextual hovering menu can be implemented.
- [**Tables**](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/tree/master/examples/tables) — showing how to nest blocks to render more advanced components.
- [**Paste HTML**](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/tree/master/examples/paste-html) — showing how to use an HTML serializer to handle pasted HTML.
- [**Code Highlighting**](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/tree/master/examples/code-highlighting) — showing how to use decorators to dynamically mark text.

If you have an idea for an example that shows a common use case, pull request it!

### Plugins

Slate encourages you to write small, reusable modules. Check out the public ones you can use in your project!

- [`slate-auto-replace`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate-auto-replace) auto-replaces text as the user types. Useful for "smart" typography!
- [`slate-collapse-on-escape`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate-collapse-on-escape) simply collapses the selection when `escape` is pressed.
- [`slate-edit-code`](https://github.com/GitbookIO/slate-edit-code) adds code editing behavior like tab-to-indent, and enter-to-soft-break.
- [`slate-edit-list`](https://github.com/GitbookIO/slate-edit-list) adds rich, nested list editing behavior.
- [`slate-edit-table`](https://github.com/GitbookIO/slate-edit-table) adds complex table editing behavior!
- [`slate-paste-linkify`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate-paste-linkify) wraps the selected text in a link when a URL is pasted from the clipboard.
- [`slate-prism`](https://github.com/GitbookIO/slate-prism) highlights code blocks with [Prism.js](http://prismjs.com/)!
- [`slate-soft-break`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate-soft-break) adds a soft break when `enter` is pressed.
- [`slate-drop-or-paste-images`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate-drop-or-paste-images) lets users drop or paste images to insert them!
- [**View all plugins on `npm`...**](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/slate)

### Documentation

If you're using Slate for the first time, check out the [Getting Started](http://docs.slatejs.org/walkthroughs/installing-slate.html) walkthroughs to familiarize yourself with Slate's architecture and mental models. Once you've gotten familiar with those, you'll probably want to check out the full [API Reference](http://docs.slatejs.org/reference/components/editor.html).

- [**FAQ**](http://docs.slatejs.org/general/faq.html)
- [**Resources**](http://docs.slatejs.org/general/resources.html)

If even that's not enough, you can always [read the source itself](./src), which is explained along with a handful of readme's and is heavily commented.
