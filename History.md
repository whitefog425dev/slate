This document maintains a list of changes to Slate with each new version. Until `1.0.0` is released, breaking changes will be added as minor version bumps, and non-breaking changes won't be accounted for since the library is moving quickly.


## `0.2.0`
_July 18, 2016_

###### BREAKING CHANGES

- Renamed the `mark` transform to `addMark`.
- Renamed the `unmark` transform to `removeMark`. 

The new names make it clearer that the transforms are actions being performed, and it paves the way for adding a `toggleMark` convenience as well.


## `0.1.0`
_July 13, 2016_

:tada:
