This document maintains a list of changes to Slate with each new version. Until `1.0.0` is released, breaking changes will be added as minor version bumps, and non-breaking changes won't be accounted for since the library is moving quickly.


---


### `0.7.0` — _July 24, 2016_

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- **The `Raw` serializer is no longer terse by default!** Previously, the `Raw` serializer would return a "terse" representation of the document, omitting information that wasn't _strictly_ necessary to deserialize later, like the `key` of nodes. By default this no longer happens. You have to opt-in to the behavior by passing `{ terse: true }` as the second `options` argument of the `deserialize` and `serialize` methods.


### `0.6.0` — _July 22, 2016_

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- **Void components are no longer rendered implicity!** Previously, Slate would automatically wrap any node with `isVoid: true` in a `<Void>` component. But doing this prevented you from customizing the wrapper, like adding a `className` or `style` property. So you **must now render the wrapper yourself**, and it has been exported as `Slate.Void`. This, combined with a small change to the `<Void>` component's structure allows the "selected" state of void nodes to be rendered purely with CSS based on the `:focus` property of a `<Void>` element, which previously [had to be handled in Javascript](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/commit/31782cb11a272466b6b9f1e4d6cc0c698504d97f). This allows us to streamline selection-handling logic, improving performance and reducing complexity.

- **`data-offset-key` is now `<key>-<index>` instead of `<key>:<start>-<end>`.** This shouldn't actually affect anyone, unless you were specifically relying on that attribute in the DOM. This change greatly reduces the number of re-renders needed, since previously any additional characters would cause a cascading change in the `<start>` and `<end>` offsets of latter text ranges.


### `0.5.0` — _July 20, 2016_

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- **`node.getTextNodes()` is now `node.getTexts()`.** This is just for consistency with the other existing `Node` methods like `getBlocks()`, `getInlines()`, etc. And it's nicely shorter. :wink:

- **`Node` methods now `throw` earlier during unexpected states.** This shouldn't break anything for most folks, unless a strange edge-case was going undetected previously.


### `0.4.0` — _July 20, 2016_

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- **`renderMark(mark, state, editor)` is now `renderMark(mark, marks, state, editor)`.** This change allows you to render marks based on multiple `marks` presence at once on a given range of text, for example using a custom `BoldItalic.otf` font when text has both `bold` and `italic` marks.


### `0.3.0` — _July 20, 2016_

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- **`transform.unwrapBlock()` now unwraps selectively.** Previously, calling `unwrapBlock` with a range representing a middle sibling would unwrap _all_ of the siblings, removing the wrapping block entirely. Now, calling it with those same arguments will only move the middle sibling up a layer in the hierarchy, preserving the nesting on any of its siblings. This changes makes it much simpler to implement functionality like unwrapping a single list item, which previously would unwrap the entire list.


### `0.2.0` — _July 18, 2016_

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- **`transform.mark()` is now `transform.addMark()` and `transform.unmark()` is now `transform.removeMark()`.** The new names make it clearer that the transforms are actions being performed, and it paves the way for adding a `toggleMark` convenience as well.


### `0.1.0` — _July 13, 2016_

:tada:
